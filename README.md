# Detecting-defects-in-solar-panels
## Abstract
This project aims to detect defective solar panels in a solar array,by performing semantic segmentation. The panels are then annotated into 
- Defect: LHS(Light Hot Spot)
- Defect: DHS(Dark Hot Spot)
- Defect: BP (ByPass diode)
- No defect: Normal


## About Folders-Navigate easier:

- **Annotation** : Contains a text file about annotations used, steps taken and problems encountered.
- **Preprocessing** : Contains notebook used to generate the dataset and the details about steps taken during preprocessing , problems encountered and such.
- **Training and results** : Contains a summary of models trained and information on them.
