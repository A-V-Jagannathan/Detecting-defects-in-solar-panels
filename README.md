# Detecting-defects-in-solar-panels
## Abstract
This project aims to detect defective solar panels in a solar array,by performing semantic segmentation. The panels are then annotated into 
- Defect: LHS(Light Hot Spot)
- Defect: DHS(Dark Hot Spot)
- Defect: BP (ByPass diode)
- No defect: Normal

## Data engineering
200 IR images of Solar arrays have been annotated using roboflow, where each panel in an array is given an annotation.
